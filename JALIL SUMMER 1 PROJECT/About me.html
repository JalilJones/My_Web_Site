        <h2> About Me</h2>

        <p>My name is Jalil Jones and i'm going to be a freshman at Bishop Odowd Highschool I Oakland California.
        I was born in San Diego, and moved to Oakland when I as about 3 yers old. I attended Ile Omode School since Pre-k up to 8th grade.
        My highest GPA was a 3.65 which was one of my greatest achomplishments. I have first heard of the hidden genius project at school in the 7th grade year when Brandon
        came to our school to tell us about the program. I liked this progam because it helps us become leaders in our communities, and help our people grow.
        I would also want help with creating my video game company. I am a strong willed person that will never GIVE UP!!! I want to thank my family, freinds, school,
        and the hidden genuis project for guiding me.
      </p>
